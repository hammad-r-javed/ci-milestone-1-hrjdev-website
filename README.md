# Milestone Project 1 - HRJDev Software Development Consultants

## Consultant Website
This repository hosts my Milestone 1 Project for the [Code Institute Full Software Development Course](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/). The goal for Milestone Project 1 is to demonstrate the skills I gained during the first module, where I learned UX design, HTML and CSS to build a static website.

The fictional website I have chosen for this project is a the webpage for a software development consultancy called `HRJDev`.
